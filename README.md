Web Scraping using Python Beautifulsoup

In this project I have scrapped IMBD site data to filter out Movie Name, Year, Metascore, Runtime, Votes, IMDB Rating and Genre for all the movies realeased between the year 2000-2017. 

Cleaning:

Though most of the data were clean after scraping the columns Genre and Year had to be cleaned in order to remove redunant characters. 

To start off learning basic web scraping using python, I have experiemted with monster.com to read its data and scrape job title, location and company name.
